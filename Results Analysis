From Baseline run , we can review that model is not yet learning the features, and not converging. This may be due to shallow design 
We will have to rerun with higher learning rate and also add more hidden layer.
Due to large variation in hyperparameters, Its going to take long time to tune this MLP with grid/ random search.
Currently optimization is using gradient search. Instead we can try the constructive learning using methods such as border pairs method.

CNN followed by MLP at the end for classification could be better fit in this case. We will have to try and play around few architectures.
